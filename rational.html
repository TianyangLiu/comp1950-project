            <h2>Changes and Re-designs</h2>
                <h3>We re-designed the Comp 1950 course website based on the Project Questionnaire filled by the client and we did following changes:
                </h3>
               
                <p>1. We organized lectures and put it into the sidebar. We have a “button” which acts as a toggle button. When the toggle button clicked, the sidebar will hide to the left or show up.</p>
                <span>Reasons:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The previous sidebar navigation occupy a large area of the website. </li>
                        <li>We used buttons and collapsible list to give users more choice and control</li>
                    </ul>
                   <br/><br/>  
                <p>2. We grouped all the lecture exercises together.</p>
                    
                <span>Reasons:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The previous sidebar navigation occupy a large area of the website. </li>
                        <li>We used buttons and collapsible list to give users more choice and control</li>
                    </ul>
                     <br/><br/>
                    <p>3. We made lecture exercises can be worked online directly by embedding the online code editor in our design.</p>
                    <span>Reasons:</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Students can can do the exercise online directly and see the result online our website rather than download the exercise zip files and coding software. </li>
                            <li>Easier to change, to experiment with </li>
                        </ul>
                     <br/><br/>
                    <p>4. We implemented the inside links for sub-topics in each lecture.</p>
                    <span>Reasons:</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Students can quickly find the lecture material that they are looking forward by click the navigation sidebar.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                    <br/><br/>
                    <p>5. We also implement the containers for each sub-topic on the lecture notes.</p>
                    <span>Reasons:</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Divide content into meaningful sections which occupies less screen space.</li>
                            <li>Let the page looks clearly and hierachically.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                    
                    <br/><br/>
                    <p>6. We implemented style rules for mobile users.</p>
                    <span>Reasons:</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The web pages chould be demonstrated more friendly than the origanal style.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
            </div>
        
            <div class="middle">
                <h3>Idea Could Not Implement</h3>
                <span>We tried to make the exercises can be done on our website without using other online coding application but did not make it.
